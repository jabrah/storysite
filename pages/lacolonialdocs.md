Target documents are currently housed at the Louisiana Historical Center (LHC) and maintained by the New Orleans Jazz Museum, one of our institutional partners. As described on their website, “The Louisiana Colonial Documents Digitization Project’s digitization and online publication of the LHC’s Colonial Documents Collection will exponentially increase access to a rich archive for researchers of every stripe, from high school students to amateur genealogists to academic historians. This twenty-first-century high-tech undertaking marks the most recent phase of a series of efforts stretching back more than a hundred years to make it easier for researchers to navigate this enormous collection of criminal and civil court cases, commercial transactions, successions, wills, and other legal documents dating back to 1714. Global access to these 220,000 pages, handwritten in French and Spanish, will open up these archives as never before to those who study Louisiana and its inhabitants.”

Through the Louisiana Colonial Document Digitization Project (LCDDP), approximately 200,000 pages of colonial documents (created between 1714 and through 1803) have been digitized by the Jazz Museum and catalogued with descriptive metadata, including subject headings. These documents represent at least one hundred genres of archival material including court cases, bills of sale, birth and death notices, manumissions, labor contracts, passports and shipping documentation, promissory notes, and medical examinations.

The LHC holds the majority of Louisiana’s eighteenth-century documents, however only approximately 3/5ths of them are at the Louisiana Historical Center. Another 2/5ths (some 110 to 120,000 documents) of the colonial documents are held by the New Orleans Notarial Archives. A smaller, undefined number are held at the New Orleans Public Library. For more on the spread of documentation on French and Spanish-occupied Louisiana, see "Housing the Louisiana Archive" a StoryMap created by Olivia Barnard, Associate French Editor and Doctoral Candidate, Department of History, Johns Hopkins University.

We are grateful to the LCDDP for permitting widespread use of their database and allowing us to provide page images of manuscript sources on our document and story sites.
