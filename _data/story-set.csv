s001,Mama Comba’s Gombeaux,1764-09-04,,,,"In Africans in Colonial Louisiana, Dr. Gwendolyn Midlo Hall argues this document offers the first Gulf Coast reference to gumbo (“un Gombeau”) in the archive. This is the testimony of Mama “Julie” Comba, a fifty year old negresse and African woman [nation Mandinga] who lived in the Hospital for the Poor [Hospital de Pauvres] and was enslaved to the Capuchin priests. Mama Comba appears before the French Superior Council in this, her second interrogation, as a result of the arrest of two runaways, the nègre Cezar, and the nègre Louis also called Foy (dit Foy). The runaways were caught and accused of murder, but ultimately charged with public drunkenness, theft and firing weapons into the air (no one was killed) and with being fugitives. Mama Comba was interrogated because she hosted a feast that Cezar and Louis were guests at, bringing with them a pig that Louis allegedly stole and that the guests all took part in cooking and eating. The document below is drawn from part of Mama Comba’s testimony.",,marronage; kinship; labor; fugitivity; rival geography; play,Mama Comba; Louis,,,,,,,,,,Image,image/jpeg,fr,,,,compound_object,,,,,,

s010,Hypolite Seeks Care,,,,,"The various resources that Hypolite manages to access during a long, painful illness shed light on medical care for the enslaved in colonial Louisiana. For eight months, an enslaved man named  experienced painful symptoms of a condition that made it difficult for him to breathe, eat, and labor for his enslavers. In the documents that follow, we learn that 's enslaver valued profit over 's health and life. His enslaver sold him, citing the costs of his care as the reason for the sale. This story consists of three parts. First, we see the enslaver's request to sell. Next, we see the colonial administration approve that request. Lastly, the third section of the document captures the public auction that took place eight days later, in front of the parish church, where another enslaver purchased .",,wellness; health; care; succession; lease,Hypolite; Marie Aram; François Tiocou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,compound_object,,,,,,
